    "expectations": "I expect to learn neat ways of visualizing information and what to think about when doing it. \n\nWeird as I am, I sort my files and like to have a 'beautiful' structure in my computers hard drives, and when I stumble upon visualizations of large quantities of data on the internet I get really fascinated, I also like to keep track and visualize things in excel sheets. What I try to say is that I think this course is for me, and that is will be a lot of fun. The need for information visualization only increases the more data we produce, and as I'm interesed in the subject I most likely will use information visualization independent of where I'll work or what I'll work with.
